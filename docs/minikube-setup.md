# Minikube Setup

Minikube is one of free alternatives to Docker for Desktop. Minikube and Docker for Desktop are both tools that allow developers to run a local Kubernetes cluster on their own machines. However, there are some key differences between the two tools:

- Docker for Desktop is a full-featured desktop application that includes Docker Engine, Kubernetes, and other tools, while Minikube is a command-line tool that provides a lightweight, single-node Kubernetes cluster.
- Docker for Desktop provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easy to manage your containers and Kubernetes cluster, while Minikube requires you to use the command line to manage your cluster.
- Docker for Desktop supports both Docker Compose and Kubernetes, while Minikube is focused solely on Kubernetes.
- Docker for Desktop can be used for both local development and production deployments, while Minikube is primarily used for local development and testing.

More information on minikube can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube).

## Clean up Docker for Desktop

This section is only applicable if Docker for Desktop is / was installed on machine. If it isn't / wasn't installed on machine this section can be skipped.

If you have Docker for Desktop installed on your machine, uninstall it before installing minikube.

Uninstall guides for Windows/Mac are available [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/uninstall/).

After that, clear the leftover Docker for Desktop data and system components.

For Windows:

1. Open the elevated (as Admin) PowerShell window, type the following command and hit Enter to remove the default networks of Docker.

        Get-HNSNetwork | Remove-HNSNetwork

2. Run the following command to clear the program date of Docker from Windows.

        Remove-Item "C:\ProgramData\Docker" -Recurse

3. Run the following command to reboot your system to execute the uninstallation and cleanup.

        Restart-Computer -Force

For MacOS:

Open terminal and execute following commands, one by one, to remove all Docker Desktop dependencies on local file system:

    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-desktop
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-ecr-login
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-osxkeychain
    sudo rm -Rf ~/.docker
    sudo rm -Rf ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker
    sudo rm -Rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Docker\ Desktop
    sudo rm -Rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker
    sudo rm -f ~/Library/HTTPStorages/com.docker.docker.binarycookies
    sudo rm -f /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.vmnetd
    sudo rm -f /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.docker.vmnetd.plist
    sudo rm -Rf ~/Library/Logs/Docker\ Desktop
    sudo rm -Rf /usr/local/lib/docker
    sudo rm -f ~/Library/Preferences/com.docker.docker.plist
    sudo rm -Rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.electron.docker-frontend.savedState
    sudo rm -f ~/Library/Preferences/com.electron.docker-frontend.plist

## Install minikube

Official installation guides are available ono minikube's [Get Started!](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) page. This guide recommends and shows installation via package managers, for Windows [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), for MacOS [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). You can chose any other method mentioned on minikube's [Get Started!](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) page, but than you must install other components and configuration on your own.

This guide will cover installing:

- Package Managers
  - for Windows [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
  - for MacOS [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Virtualization Engine
  - for Windows `Hyper-V`
  - for Mac `HyperKit`
- Additionally needed tools and command line interfaces
  - Docker CLI
  - Docker Build X
- Host File Configuration

### Windows

1. Open PowerShell with administrator privileges
2. Install Chocolatey by running the following command:

        Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

3. Install Hyper-V by running the following command:

        choco install hyper-v -y

4. Install Minikube by running the following command:

        choco install minikube -y

5. Verify the installation by running the following command:

        minikube version

6. Install Docker CLI by running the following command:

        choco install docker-cli -y
  
7. Verify the installation by running the following command:

        docker version

### MacOS

1. Open Terminal
2. Install Homebrew by running the following command:

        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

3. Install HyperKit by running the following command:

        brew install hyperkit

4. Install Minikube by running the following command:

        brew install minikube

5. Verify the installation by running the following command:

        minikube version

6. Install Docker CLI by running the following command:

        brew install docker

7. Install Docker Buildx by running the following command:

        brew install docker-buildx

    - docker-buildx is a Docker plugin. For Docker to find this plugin, symlink it:

          mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins
          ln -sfn $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/docker-buildx/bin/docker-buildx ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx

8. Verify the installation by running the following command:

        docker version

## Start minikube

To start minikube, it is important that on first initial start configuration is passed with configuration flags.

Recommendation is to give minikube half of machines resources, if you have 16GB or RAM, give minikube 8GB of RAM, if you have 8 core CPU, give minikube 4 cores.

To be able to use ports like 80, 8080, 1234, 9090, 9000 and 4000 which are used Sorry-Cypress and Restful Booker Platform it is needed to extend NodePort range from default range 30000-32767 to 1-65535.

Initial start of minikube:

On Windows:

1. Open PowerShell with administrator privileges
2. Start minikube by running the following command:

        minikube start --memory 8192 --cpus 4 --extra-config=apiserver.service-node-port-range=1-65535

      - sometime error can occurs during initial start, in that case stop minikube, purge it and start again with same command:

            minikube stop
            minikube delete --all --purge
            minikube start --memory 8192 --cpus 4 --extra-config=apiserver.service-node-port-range=1-65535

On MacOs:

1. Open Terminal
2. Start minikube by running the following command (you will be asked for sudo rights):

        minikube start --memory 8192 --cpus 4 --extra-config=apiserver.service-node-port-range=1-65535

      - sometime error can occurs during initial start, in that case stop minikube, purge it and start again with same command:

            minikube stop
            minikube delete --all --purge
            minikube start --memory 8192 --cpus 4 --extra-config=apiserver.service-node-port-range=1-65535

After minikube is initially started like this, every next start can be just with the command:

    minikube start

When you finish testing / using minikube for the day, do not forget to stop it to conserve machine resources, with command:

    minikube stop

Next time when you start it it will be in same state as when you stopped it.

Minikube configuration can always be checked in `~/.minikube/machines/minikube/config.json` file.
